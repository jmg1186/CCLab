<p> Crabicus crabicus emerged from the depths of the ocean after his habitat became to acidic and deoxingenated through the exessive output of CO2 and deposition of synthetic fertilizer runoff in the Gulf of Mexico.
    A giant crab which emerges from the water to terrorize the citizens of a suburban neighborhood. The crab is motivated to come above water for the first time because it is the last of its kind who have all been killed by the acidification of the Earth's oceans and the fertilizer runoff which depletes the oxygen levels in the water off the coast of Louisiana. He is marching to the pentagon to exact his vengeance on the world's largest polluter, the United States military. The military however has already sprung in to action, launching a barrage of missiles against the crab. But the crab is unfazed by such small munitions. Will they need a nuclear bomb to protect the heart of the military-industrial complex???
