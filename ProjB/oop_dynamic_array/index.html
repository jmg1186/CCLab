                    <p>In the early 21st century there was a rising awareness of the effects that single-use plastics were having on our bodies and environment.</p>
            
                    <h3 class="clASS">Environmental Consequneces:</h3>
                    <p>Single-use plastics degrade over a period exceeding the length of a human life, thus many of the single-use plastic products an individual uses will actually outlive them and those reading this in the future may inhabit a world where these artifacts are still to be found. Many of these items become litter or enter landfills. Plastic waste contibutes to a significant amount of the mass accumulated at the center of ocean gyres where there are no strong currents.</p>
                    <h3>Health Consequences:</h3>
                    <p>The degredation of single-use plastics leads to the spread of "microplastics" which we have discovered in animals, throughout the oceans and even in our own bodies. The legacy of plastic products is already understood to be long-lasting and significant. In the future it is possible that such products will fall out of use.</p>

            <h3>Explore:</h3>
            Observe the journey of single-use plastics from fabrication to non-recycled disposal in order to gain an appreciation for how people used to live and how the environmental changes whose conseuwnces we now live with came about.
    
            <h3>Stages</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Creation: Fill a mold with liquid plastic to create a spork! This spork will be packaged and shipped in bult across the world for use at barbeques, picnics, packed lunches, and more.</li>
                <li>Use: Eat with the spork, the spork has not fulfilled its purpose!</li>
                <li>Disposal and Dispersion: Having been used once, the spork is not disposed of and because it was carelessly disposed of as litter by the sea, it washes out into the ocean! The spork will embark on a great journey across the worlds oceans where it will drift into the most remote areas and leech plastic for centuries!</li>
            </ul>
